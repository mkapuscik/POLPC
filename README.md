PoLPC is a [Point of Load Power Supply](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/231325/what-is-a-point-of-load-converter) I designed to solve the problem or reliably powering more than 200 watts of individually addressable RGB stretched out across 200ft at [Santa Barbara Hackerspace](www.sbhackerspace.com). It's main objective is to step down 12V to 5V as efficiently and cheaply as possible. The design must also be very rugged and not require any additional cooling as these regulators will be in hard to reach areas.
